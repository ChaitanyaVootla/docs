# deploy
`deploy` is a job that deploys an app/service definition ([manifest](/platform/workflow/job/manifest)) to a [cluster](/platform/workflow/resource/cluster). One very powerful concept with this job is that if you add resources like [params](/platform/workflow/resource/params), [dockerOptions](/platform/workflow/resource/dockeroptions) and [replicas](/platform/workflow/resource/replicas), it can override the service definition from the manifest. This is very useful in multi-environment deployments, e.g., pushing a Docker-based app through Dev, Test, and Prod.

A new version is created anytime this job is executed.

You can create a `deploy` job by [adding](/platform/tutorial/workflow/crud-job#adding) it to **shippable.yml**. These jobs execute on Shippable provided runtime.

A description of the job YML structure and the tags available is in the [jobs section of the anatomy of shippable.yml](/platform/workflow/config/#jobs) page.

* **`name`** -- should be an easy to remember text string

* **`type`** -- is set to `deploy`

* **`maxWaitTime`** -- Optional. The maximum amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a deployment to become stable before considering the deployment to have failed.  Stable means that the desired number of replicas matches the number that are actually running in the cluster. The default wait time is ten minutes and the maximum is one hour.

* **`stabilityDuration`** -- Optional. The amount of time in seconds (0-300) that a new service created in a blueGreen deployment should be stable before marking the deployment as successful.  Stable means that the desired number of replicas matches the number that are actually running in the cluster. This setting is ignored if deployment method is not blueGreen.

* **`method`** -- Optional. This is used to control the strategy used to deploy the service. The following are accepted values:
    * `blueGreen` -- This is the default method. The newer version of the the service is brought up and runs side by side with the older version for a brief amount of time. Once the new version is completely up, the older version is stopped. Shippable handles this scenario gracefully and these deployments are zero downtime deployments.

    * `upgrade` -- If possible, the deployment is updated in-place.  Otherwise, the newer version of the service is deployed and the older version is brought down without waiting for the newer version to complete its deployment.  Ideally this will not create downtime, but the exact behavior depends on the cluster provider being used.  See our [CD scenarios](http://docs.shippable.com/deploy/continuous-delivery/) for some details about the upgrade workflow for particular providers.

    * `replace` -- The old version of the service is brought down before deploying the new version. This type of deployment always has some downtime, depending on how quickly the container service is able to stop and start applications. It is mostly intended to be used for deployments to clusters with limited resources, where it's not possible to run more than one instance of the same task in parallel.

* **`workflow`** -- Optional. This may be set to either `serial` (default) or `parallel`.  If it is `parallel`, manifests will be deployed in parallel.

* **`dependencyMode`** -- Optional. This may be set to `immediate`, `strict` or `chrono`. For detailed explanation, read about [job triggering mechanisms](/platform/workflow/job/overview/#job-trigger-modes)

* **`steps`** -- is an object which contains specific instructions to run this job
    * `IN` -- You need one `cluster` and at least one `manifest`-based input (`manifest`, `release`, or `deploy`). You have can have more than one of these and if you use multiple, each `manifest` will be deployed as a separate service. Below is the list of all resources and jobs that can be supplied as `IN`.
        * [cluster](/platform/workflow/resource/cluster) -- Required input, location where you want your services to be deployed.

        * [manifest](/platform/workflow/job/manifest) -- You can add zero or more of these. If you add more than one, they will be deployed as separate entities. This means if only one of the manifests changes, only that one will be deployed. Manifests, including manifests that are a part of release or deploy inputs, will be deployed in the order listed.
            * `force` -- (default `false`) Optional input. Set to `true` if you need to deploy the `manifest` even when it hasn't changed (deployment could have been triggered by some other change).
            * `deployName` -- Optional input. The deploy job uses the value given for the deployName tag as the deployment name. Note that blueGreen deployments will have a suffix of build number in their deployment names. So the deployment name will be of the format deployName-buildNumber in a blueGreen deployment. Upgrade and replace deployments expect deployName to be present during the first deployment. The name used in the previous deployment will be used in subsequent deployments for upgrade or replace deploy methods. Hence, modifying deployName in a later deployment will not take effect with an upgrade or replace method.

        * [release](/platform/workflow/job/release) -- You can add zero or more of these. `release` jobs can also contain zero or more `manifests` that have been semantically tagged with a release version number. If you have more than one `release` job as `IN` they are deployed seperately and only the ones that change are deployed.

        * [deploy](/platform/workflow/job/deploy) -- You can add zero or more of these. `deploy` jobs can be `IN`s to other deploy jobs.  They contain a list of `manifests` that were deployed.  This same list can be augmented with new `params` or `dockerOptions` and deployed in a new job.
            * `force` -- (default `false`) Optional input. Set to `true` if you need to deploy the `deploy` manifests even if nothing has changed.

        * [gitRepo](/platform/workflow/resource/gitrepo) -- You can add zero or more of these. These will be copied to the cluster nodes when deploying to a node cluster.  A `gitRepo` resource will not be deployed to any other cluster type.

        * [dockerOptions](/platform/workflow/resource/dockeroptions) -- Optional input, but invalid if the manifest is not for an image. It is used to set specific container options. If more than one is provided, a UNION operation is performed to create an unique set and applied to all the `image` resources. Items are applied in the order they are provided in `steps`. If you want a `dockerOptions` resource to modify specific entities, use an `applyTo` tag.

        * [replicas](/platform/workflow/resource/replicas) -- Optional input, but invalid if the manifest is not for an image. It is used to set the number of manifest copies to start for all manifests in the job (manifests can come from other deploy jobs, release jobs, and manifest jobs). It can also be used to set up auto scaling in an Amazon ECS deployment. If you want a `replicas` resource to apply to specific manifests, use an `applyTo` tag along with one or more manifest names.  The `replicas` count will be ignored if deploying to Amazon ECS with `schedulingStrategy` set to `DAEMON`.

        * [params](/platform/workflow/resource/params) -- Optional input, and it works for both `image` and `file` based jobs. It is used to set environment variables during deployment. If more than one is provided, an UNION operation is performed to create an unique set and applied to all the `image` or `file` resources in a`manifest`, `release`, or `deploy` input. Items are applied in the order they are provided in `steps`. If you want a `params` resource to apply to specific entities, use an `applyTo` tag.

        * [loadBalancer](/platform/workflow/resource/loadbalancer) -- Optional input,  applies only to `image` based deploys. If provided, the below attributes are required. It is used to attach a load balancer to a particular service and automatically update routing information upon subsequent deployments.
            * `manifest` -- Required for loadBalancer. Name of the manifest, i.e., service to which the loadBalancer will be attached.
            * `image` -- Required for loadBalancer. Name of the image, i.e., container running the Docker image within the manifest.
            * `port` -- Required for loadBalancer. The container port that will be exposed to the load balancer.

        * Any other job or resource will only participate in triggering the `deploy` job, not in the processing of it.
        * While using a kubernetes [cluster](/platform/workflow/resource/cluster) or [loadBalancer](/platform/workflow/resource/loadbalancer) if bastion host is used to configured kubernetes cluster a sshKey or pemKey [integration](/platform/workflow/resource/integration) resource is required.

    * `TASK` -- Optional, this should only be used for scripts following deployment of files to a [Node Cluster](/platform/integration/nodeCluster/).
        * `script` -- Optional input. This is used to run a script after deployment, but this can be used only if the `deploy` is for a `file`-based `manifest` and the `cluster` resource has an integration of type [Node Cluster](/platform/integration/nodeCluster/).


* **`on_start`**, **`on_success`**, **`on_failure`**, **`on_cancel`**, **`always`** are used to send notifications for those events. You need to provide a [**notification**](/platform/workflow/resource/notification) resource pointing to a provider like Slack, Email, IRC, Hipchat, etc.

**Note:** Since `deploy` jobs are managed, free-form scripting is not allowed. `on_start`, `on_success`, `on_failure`, `on_cancel` and `always` only support `NOTIFY` tags.
