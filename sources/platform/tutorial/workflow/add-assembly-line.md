# Adding an Assembly Line to Shippable

Your entire workflow configuration lives in a YAML-based file called **shippable.yml**. You can find the configuration reference [here](/platform/workflow/config).

The Assembly Line part of the configuration are the `jobs` and `resources` sections. You need to add your config to Shippable, so that we can read these sections of the config and create your workflows.

When you add Assembly Line config to Shippable, the platform automatically creates two things:

* A `syncRepo` resource pointing to the repository containing your configuration. We also add webhooks to this repository to detect any changes in config.
* An `rSync` job which parses your configuration and creates your workflows. The `rSync` job is triggered automatically whenever the `syncRepo` changes, so that your workflows are always in sync with your config.  

The name of the `syncRepo` is the name of the repository with the name of the branch appended with an `_`. The `rSync` job name is the `syncRepo`'s name + `_rSync`

**Note** You should not add the same repository/branch as a `syncRepo` more than once.

## Instructions

* First, add an integration for the source control provider where your sync repository is located. Instructions are here for different providers:
     - [GitHub](/platform/integration/github/)
     - [GitHub Enterprise](/platform/integration/github-enterprise/)
     - [Bitbucket](/platform/integration/bitbucket/)
     - [GitLab](/platform/integration/gitlab/)

* Go to your Subscription's page on Shippable. A list of all available Subscriptions can be accessed by clicking on the **Subscriptions** menu in your left navigation bar:

* On the top-right corner, click on the `+` icon(`Enable Projects or Add syncRepo`).
* On the **Enable** page, in the **Enable CI project or Manage Assembly Line** section, click on `+` button in the **Manage Assembly Line** column of the repository where your config is stored. This will open a modal window.

* Complete the form:
     * **Subscription Integration** dropdown shows the integration you created in the first step. If not, you will need to go through the flow of adding the integration.
     * **Branch** dropdown shows all the branches for the above selected repository. Select the branch that contains your workflow configuration files.
     * Name your sync repository with an easy to remember name.
     * **Default Flag** checkbox is checked by default. When this is checked a default flag is added to all the resources and jobs in this Assembly Line.
     * Click on **Save** to add your Assembly Line.

At this point, Shippable automatically creates two things:

* A `syncRepo` resource pointing to the repository containing your configuration. We also add webhooks to this repository to detect any changes in config.
* An `rSync` job which parses your configuration and creates your workflows. The `rSync` job is triggered automatically whenever the `syncRepo` changes, so that your workflows are always in sync with your config.  

You can see the syncRepo and rSync job in the Single Pane of Glass (click on the `Eye` icon on the top-right corner on your Subscription page  and choose `Show SPOG view`):

## Updating syncRepo fields

### Subscription integration

Once added, you can edit the name, Subscription integration used, and flags of syncRepo.

To change the `syncRepo` name and Subscription integration used:

* Go to your Subscription's page on Shippable. A list of all available Subscriptions can be accessed by clicking on the **Subscriptions** menu in your left navigation bar.

* Click on the `+` button on your Subscription page. Search for the repository containing your Assembly Line config and click on the name of the **syncRepo** you want to edit.

* Select **Edit** from the dropdown:

* You can now add/change the subscription integration used by the **syncRepo**.

### Flags

The default flag may be changed in the UI and additional flags added in your **shippable.yml**. Adding a flag will include that syncRepo, and all of its resources and jobs, in the SPOG view when you filter on that flag.

#### Change default flag:

* Click on the `syncRepo` resource in your [SPOG view](/platform/visibility/single-pane-of-glass-spog). This will take you the history page:

* You can add/change the default flag here.

#### Add additional flags:

* Add your syncRepo to the `resources` section of the [shippable.yml](/platform/workflow/config/) file in that syncRepo with the additional flags:

```
resources:
  - name: mySyncRepo
    type: syncRepo
    flags:
      - additionalFlag1
      - additionalFlag2
```

* Make sure that the name matches the name of your syncRepo in the UI.
